## About Syrup

The Syrup platform, built by Maple Labs, enables users permissionless access to secured,
institutional lending for the first time. By depositing USDC into the platform, users receive
LP tokens (syrupUSDC) and begin earning yield immediately. All of the yield generated by
Syrup is sourced from secured loans to the largest institutions in crypto, fully collateralized
with digital assets.
